A Python-based file transfer application that accelerates the transmission of large files by utilizing **parallel TCP connections**, breaking files into smaller chunks and transmitting them concurrently. It enhances speed, reliability, and efficiency in file transfers, perfect for large data transfers across a congested networks.

## üöÄ Features
- **Parallel Transmission**: Utilizes multiple TCP connections to transfer file chunks concurrently.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Displays transfer speed, percentage completed, and estimated time remaining.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles interruptions during transfer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- Required Libraries:
  - `socket`
  - `threading`
  - `os`
  - `time`

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prathampt/parallelFileTransfer.git
cd parallelFileTransfer
```

## Methodology
The application is designed around the concept of **parallelism** in file transmission. Here's how it works:

### 1. File Chunking
The file to be transferred is divided into smaller chunks, each of which can be sent over separate TCP connections. The client sends these chunks concurrently to the server using multiple threads.

### 2. Parallel TCP Connections
Instead of transmitting the file sequentially, the application opens multiple **TCP connections**. Each connection handles a specific chunk of the file, reducing overall transfer time by utilizing network bandwidth more effectively.

### 3. Real-time Progress Monitoring
The application calculates and displays:
- **Percentage Complete**: Shows how much of the file has been transferred.
- **Transfer Speed**: Calculates the speed in MB/s.
- **Estimated Time Remaining**: Dynamically estimates how long the transfer will take to complete based on the current speed.

### 4. Error Handling
If a connection is interrupted, the application catches the error and ensures no data is lost or corrupted, resuming the transfer where it left off.

## üîß Usage

### Starting the Server
Run the server script to start receiving file chunks. The server listens on a specified port and waits for connections from clients.
```bash
python main.py -r receiver -s ./data/
```

### Sending Files as a Client
Run the client script, specifying the file to transfer and the server's IP address. The client breaks the file into chunks and sends them over multiple TCP connections.
```bash
python main.py -r sender <file_path> <receiver_ip>
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can adjust the number of parallel connections and the chunk size by modifying the corresponding variables in the code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements
- **Encryption**: Implement end-to-end encryption for secure file transfers.
- **Compression**: Add file compression to reduce the amount of data sent over the network.
- **Better error handling**: Improve recovery from network interruptions.
